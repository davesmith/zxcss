Realised that there are functions dependent on the app and utility functions.
And that the beauty of a function is that the dependencies are delivered via the arguments array.

So, was thinking that instead of all this classes, prototyping malarkey that requires understanding of what "this" is 
at any point, I'd just pass an object with everything in it and forget "this"
